### Investment options for salaried individuals
**Systematic Investment In Equity Oriented Product**
          Salaried individuals have fixed monthly income unlike a self-employed or businessman, which means that they have to manage investment and expenses within a stipulated income.A young earner has fewer responsibilities in the beginning of a career and his/her potential to take risk is high. Therefore, they can consider investing in an equity-oriented product. Within equity class, the investment should be done in a systematic way, i.e. instead of putting the money once in a year or so, it should be invested in instalments every month. You can invest in the Mutual Fund SIP if you are not comfortable with a direct investment in the stock market. Within equity mutual fund scheme, you should diversify investment as per risk and return expectation and in sync with your financial goal. 
Some of the mutual funds are:
-ICICI Prudential Focused Bluechip Equity Fund
-Tata Equity PE Fund
-HDFC Monthly Income Plan 


**Invest In Recurring Or Fixed Deposit**
             A Fixed Deposit is considered as the safest form of investment as the return is guaranteed after the tenure is over. It not only cultivates a habit of saving, but fixed deposits offer higher interest rates than a normal Savings Account.
             Some of them are:Shriram,ICICI etc..
             
             
**PPF For Long-Term Financial Goal**
             Public Provident Fund (PPF) is one of the safest investment options, but at the same time, it comes with a lock-in period of 15 years. Putting money in PPF can help the salaried individuals to ensure that they can’t use that fund for short-term needs. PPF investment can be useful to meet the long-term requirements such as marriage, child education or buying a home, etc. The present interest rate on PPF is 7.6% which is a tax-free return. PPF also helps the salaried individual to reduce the tax liability by getting a deduction U/s 80 (C)
             
             
**Invest In NPS For Retirement Planning**
                It is important that you start planning for your retirement from the beginning of your career. A salaried individual can get tax benefits and a moderate return while investing in the NPS. Investment in NPS is meant for the long term. Investment in NPS must be done in sync with the financial objective and after discounting any other retirement focused you already have. Apart from achieving the retirement goal, you also get the tax deduction benefit by investing in NPS under Section 80C
                
                
**Invest In Gold**
                Gold is believed to be one of the safest hedges against inflation. Salaried individual’s requirement for gold increases as they progress in the career and life. Instead of buying physical gold, a salaried person should accumulate the yellow metal by investing money in Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) in a regular interval and get the benefit of interest income at 2.5% p.a. and also get the capital appreciation benefit in the long term. The redemption of SGB investment on completion of tenure is tax-free. So, by investing in SGB, a salaried person gets benefits like capital appreciation, interest income and tax benefit on redemption.
                
                
### Investment options for other Indians
**National Pension System**
               The National Pension System (NPS) is a long term retirement - focused investment product managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). The minimum annual (April-March) contribution for an NPS Tier-1 account to remain active has been reduced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 1,000. It is a mix of equity, fixed deposits, corporate bonds, liquid funds and government funds, among others.
               
               
**Real Estate**
                  The house that you live in is for self-consumption and should never be considered as an investment. If you do not intend to live in it, the second property you buy can be your investment. The location of the property is the single most important factor that will determine the value of your property and also the rental that it can earn. Investments in real estate deliver returns in two ways - capital appreciation and rentals.The other big risk is with getting the necessary regulatory approvals, which has largely been addressed after coming of the real estate regulator. 
                  
                  
**Gold**
              Possessing gold in the form of jewellery has its own concerns like safety and high cost. Then there's the 'making charges', which typically range between 6-14 per cent of the cost of gold (and may go as high as 25 percent in case of special designs). For those who would want to buy gold coins, there's still an option. One can also buy ingeniously minted coins. An alternate way of owning paper gold in a more cost-effective manner is through gold ETFs 
              
              
**Public Provident Fund (PPF)**
              The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is one product a lot of people turn to. Since the PPF has a long tenure of 15 years, the impact of compounding of tax-free interest is huge, especially in the later years. Further, since the interest earned and the principal invested is backed by sovereign guarantee, it makes it a safe investment .
              
              
**RBI Taxable Bonds**
              The government has replaced the erstwhile 8 percent Savings (Taxable) Bonds 2003 with the 7.75 per cent Savings (Taxable) Bonds. These bonds come with a tenure of 7 years. The bonds may be issued in demat form and credited to the Bond Ledger Account (BLA) of the investor and a Certificate of Holding is given to the investor as proof of investment.
