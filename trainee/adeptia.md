# **Adeptia:**

## **About**:

-   Adeptia ETL Suite (AES) is a graphical, easy-to-use data mapping
    solution that is ideal for aggregating data from multiple sources to
    populate databases and data warehouses for Business
    Intelligence solutions. AES is a comprehensive solution that
    combines data transport with powerful metadata management and data
    transformation capability.
-   Adeptia is a software company that enables business users to create
    connections with customers and partners in minutes.
-   Adeptia believes business users should be able to access information
    anywhere, anytime by creating data connections themselves, and its
    mission is to enable that self-service capability.
-   Adeptia is a unique social network for digital business connectivity
    for “citizen integrators” (who gathers clients and organisations
    needs to analyze data requirements) to respond quickly to business
    opportunities and get to revenue faster.
-   Adeptia has created its Connect product to completely change the
    traditional approach of how companies exchange data and information
    with other businesses.
-   It also reduces B2B operating costs by automating the processes
    involved, including human workflows, error handling data routing and
    validation, integration into backend systems and more.

## **Features**:

-   **A Business Application, Not A Developer Tool:**
    Adeptia Connect is a business application designed for use by non-technical
    business users. Traditional integration and connectivity solutions
    are developer tools that are designed to be used for engineers
    and programmers.
-   **Collaboration Portal (for Internal and External Users):**
    Adeptia Connect provides a web-based interface for users from a company and
    their customers and partners to work in the same place and
    create connections. This is valuable because everyone sees the same
    thing and can collaborate on creating the connections and then
    managing them and resolving any issues and problems
-   **Customer and Supplier Portal:**
    Adeptia Connect acts as a customer
    or supplier portal for a company as it allows an organization to
    provide all the information to its trading partners to learn about
    the connection options and then create and manage data interfaces.
    This eliminates the need for companies to create proprietary portals
    and for their external partners to login and do the work in separate
    portals for each compan
-   **Shared Connections:**
    Companies publish a Shared Connection, which
    is a pre-defined connection template, and many hundreds of partners
    can connect to this one shared connection. So, instead of managing
    hundreds of individual point-to-point connections, companies just
    need to manage a few shared connections. This dramatically
    simplifies and reduces the effort needed to create, manage and add
    connections
-   **Monitoring Dashboard:**
    Adeptia Connect provides a useful Dashboard
    to easily view in real-time the information that is being exchanged
    for your company and also see the historical logs and history of
    what data has been processed. This provides an easy way to go back
    and verify that data was correctly delivered or if there were any
    problems or errors
-   **Security:**
    Adeptia Connect provides secure, end-to-end encrypted
    environment for all data that is transferred and exchanged between
    companies in the application. All users are individually authorized
    and authenticated when they are registered and login to
    the application. All data transfers are over encrypted connections.
-   **Messaging:**
    Adeptia Connect has a Message Center to keep track of
    all the administrative messages, invites and approvals that are sent
    between users in your company and the external entities. This makes
    it easier to centrally manage all communication with your network.
-   **One-to-Many Approach:**
    Adeptia Connect throws out the traditional
    point-to-point approach to connecting with other companies. The
    typical way to connect with other companies is to ask them how they
    will send or receive information from you and then create specific
    point-to-point connections with them. So, if you have 500 customers
    and partners with whom you need to exchange data files, you would
    create at least 500 individual connections with them, often many
    times that because separate connections are needed for each type of
    incoming and outgoing transaction. This is a nightmare to implement
    and then manage because data formats and protocols change or new
    partners are added all the time.
-   **Data Protocolos:**
    Adeptia Connect provides support for rich set of
    commonly used data protocols, such as FTP, SFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, Email,
    SOAP, REST Web Services etc.

## **Pros comparing its competitors:**

-   Easy-to-use interface is Adeptia’s key strength and the users don’t
    need to be aware of the technical details in order to use it. This
    helps to quickly add new customers and partners, reducing dependency
    on the IT team.
-   Using the software, businesses can focus more of growth instead of
    worrying about their data connections. The software focuses on
    self-service and allows IT teams to be more productive and
    responsive to business needs.
-   It works great for data-driven service providers, including payroll
    providers, marketing services companies, claim service providers,
    billing, collection as well as retail and manufacturing industry.
    These service providers usually need to take customer data onboard
    before starting to provide services. Any delay in this process means
    delayed or lost revenue and this is where Adeptia plays its role by
    quickly onboarding the data.
-   Lowering your total cost of ownership (TCO)
-   Reducing ongoing operational costs

## **Cons comparing its competitors:**

-   No mobile support.
-   The software is sold as something that is very easy to use, but that
    is only for very basic file transfers.
-   Not an opensourse software.
