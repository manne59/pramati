## **Postgres_SET_3:**


**1. SQL to find the missing ids from dep**

**With generate_series function**

```
SELECT generate_series(
                  (SELECT MIN(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept),
                  (SELECT MAX(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept)) 
AS MissingID 
EXCEPT SELECT dept_id 
FROM dept ORDER BY MissingID ;

Select
	*
FROM
	generate_series (
		(SELECT MIN(dept_id) FROM dept),
		(SELECT MAX(dept_id) FROM dept)
	) AS sn
LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.dept_id = sn
where dept_id is null

```

**Without generate series function**

```

WITH RECURSIVE series AS (
	SELECT
		1 AS rn
	UNION ALL
		SELECT
			rn + 1 AS rn
		FROM
			series
		WHERE
			rn < 10
) SELECT
	*
FROM
	series
```
**2. Manager Name, Reportee who joined first (Reportee Name - doj), Reportee who draws less sal (Reportee Name - salary)**

**Without Window Function**
```
SELECT a.name,a.doj AS "Reportee Name - doj",b.sal AS "Reportee Name - salary"
FROM
(SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.joining_date) AS doj 
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id 
         AND EXISTS(
           SELECT 1
           FROM employee a_inr
           WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
           HAVING min(a_inr.joining_date)=a.joining_date
          ) 
) a
INNER JOIN (
SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.salary) AS sal	
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id
         AND EXISTS(
             SELECT 1
             FROM employee a_inr
             WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
             HAVING min(a_inr.salary)=a.salary
              
           )
)b
ON a.name=b.name;

```
**With Window Fucntion**
1
```
SELECT m1.Manager_name,m1.jd,m2.sd
FROM(
    SELECT DISTINCT m2.name AS Manager_name,FIRST_VALUE(CONCAT(m1.name,'-',m1.joining_date)) OVER(PARTITION BY m1.mgr_id ORDER BY     m1.joining_date) 
   AS jd
   FROM employee m1, employee m2
   WHERE m2.emp_id=m1.mgr_id)m1
   INNER JOIN(
              SELECT DISTINCT m2.name AS Manager_name,FIRST_VALUE(CONCAT(m1.name,'-',m1.salary)) OVER (PARTITION BY m1.mgr_id ORDER BY m1.salary) AS sd 
              FROM employee m1, employee m2
              WHERE m2.emp_id=m1.mgr_id)m2
              ON m1.Manager_name=m2.Manager_name;
```
2
```
SELECT DISTINCT
	M . NAME AS mgr_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e. NAME) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.joining_date
	) AS first_emp_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e.joining_date) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.joining_date
	) AS first_doj,
	FIRST_VALUE (e. NAME) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.salary
	) AS least_sal_emp_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e.salary) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.salary
	) AS least_salary
FROM
	employee e
INNER JOIN employee M ON e.mgr_id = M .emp_id

```      


**3. salary_history id,name,start_date,end_date,salary 1,Aneesh,2010,2011,1000
1,Aneesh,2011,2012,1100--1,Aneesh,2011,2014,1100 1,Aneesh,2014,2015,1200 1,Aneesh,2015,null,1200 
Find the list of employee records WHERE salary data is missing
With the above example, we donâ€™t have salary information FROM 2012 to 2014
Assume, if above data is as commented, then there is no missing as there is no gap**


```
select * from (
SELECT
	sh.start_date,
	sh.end_date,
	LEAD (start_date, 1) OVER (ORDER BY start_date) AS next_start_date
FROM
	sh
ORDER BY
	start_date)t where next_start_date-end_date > 0

```

## **Postgres_SET_4:**

**1. create a csv file with sample data like below with 10 to 20 records**
emp_id |     name      | dept_id | mgr_id | salary | joining_date | termination_date | mgr_name
--------+---------------+---------+--------+--------+--------------+------------------+----------
      1 | Harish        |         |        |  90000 | 1990-12-17   | 2015-12-17       |



**2. Load the csv to table using psql command**

```
psql -h 172.17.10.109 -U python_app -d training -c "\copy employee (emp_id,name,dept_id,mgr_id,salary,joining_date,termination_date) FROM 'Downloads/sql4.csv' with (format csv,header true, delimiter ',');"
```


**3. While loading the table, if the given mgr_id is not in emp table, insert/update should fail**

```
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_employee_Code FOREIGN KEY (mgr_id)
REFERENCES employee (emp_id) ;

```

**4. While loading the table, if the given dept_id is not in dept table, we should insert a record in dept table first with id and name as dept_id in the csv and then insert the employee table**
```
INSERT
    BEFORE
    AFTER
, UPDATE, DELETE

```
**5. create a new employee table (say employee1) with the same structure and constraints of employee table but not data**

``` 
CREATE TABLE employee1
AS
 SELECT * FROM employee
 WHERE 1=0;

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createtable.html
```

**6. add a new column peer_emp_ids array**
```
ALTER TABLE employee1 ADD COLUMN peer_emp_ids int[];
```
**7. write an insert statement to populate this table from employee table where peer_emp_ids is the employee ids of its manager excluding the given employee**

```
insert into employee1
SELECT
	*, (
		SELECT
			ARRAY_AGG (emp_id)
		FROM
			employee e_inr
		WHERE
			e_inr.mgr_id = e.mgr_id
	) - ARRAY [ e.emp_id ]
FROM
	employee e
```

**8. Write a SQL to find all the employees for the given employee id where the given employee is part of using peer_emp_ids**
```
SELECT
	*
FROM
	employee e
INNER JOIN employee1 e1 ON e.emp_id = ANY (e1.peer_emp_ids)
WHERE
	e1.emp_id = 3
```
