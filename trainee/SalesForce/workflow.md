**What is Workflow?**

    Workflow automates the following types of actions based on your organization's processes:
    - Tasks:Assign a new task to a user, role, or record owner.
    - Alerts:Send an email to one or more recipients you specify.
    - Field Updates:Update the value of a field on a record.
    - Outbound Messages:Send a secure, configurable API message (in XML format) to a designated listener.


**Each workflow rule consists of:**

    - Criteria that cause the workflow rule to run.
    - Immediate actions that execute when a record matches the criteria. For example, Salesforce can automatically send an email that notifies the account team when a new high-value opportunity is created.
    - Time-dependent actions that queue when a record matches the criteria, and execute according to time triggers. For example, Salesforce can automatically send an email reminder to the account team if a high-value opportunity is still open ten days before the close date.
